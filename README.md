# Tailwind PostCss PurgeCss Parcel Eleventy

This is an example of my simple Parcel setup for using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) in combination with Eleventy.

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn
```

After that, start up Parcel:

```
npm run dev
```
